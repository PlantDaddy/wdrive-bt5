# Welcome to WDrive - A Android GPS tether script for Linux #

### **So, what is WDrive?** ###
Wdrive is a script for Linux that allows you to tether GPS data from your Android phone through USB.
While the GPS data is being transfered it is assigned to AP's (Wireless Access Points) discovered while "wardriving".

A simple, nice and clean GUI also helps you to create a database file aswell as a .KML file that you can load up in
google maps, google earth or any other .KML reading software which will allow you to check where the AP's are located aswell as
informations about clients connected, security and more!


### **Does WDrive support Bluetooth/other connection solutions?** ###

No, not at this very moment.
I might add support for this in the future.


### **I am having problems with the script, where can I get help?** ###

If you need help, don't hesitate to contact me at: zatixiz@gmail.com
